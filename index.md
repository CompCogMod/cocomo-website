# Our lab investigate how cognitive processes such as memory, learning, and decision-making develop and operate, with a focus on the domains of language and concepts. We leverage machine learning methods and cognitive models in order to understand how people actively adapt their behavior to navigate a changing environment.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our research explores the mechanisms of cognition through the lens of computational models and statistical methods. 
One current focus of the lab is to use Bayesian psychometric models as a means to build testable, extensible theories of early language development, combining large datasets on children's early learning environment (e.g., video and audio from head-mounted cameras), tested on databases of early productive vocabulary.
