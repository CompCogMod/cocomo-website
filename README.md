# Welcome to the CoCoMo (Computational Cognitive Models) Lab!

Our research explores the mechanisms of cognition through the lens of computational models and statistical methods. We investigate how cognitive processes such as memory, learning, and decision-making develop and operate, with a particular focus on language and concept learning. By integrating machine learning with process-based cognitive models, we aim to uncover the principles that drive human cognition and apply these insights to advance both theoretical understanding and practical applications.
