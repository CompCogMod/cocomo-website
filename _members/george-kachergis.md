George studied Computer Science and Cognitive Studies at Carleton College in wintry Minnesota before questing to the cornfields of Indiana where he achieved his Ph.D. in Cognitive Science and Cognitive Psychology. After trying to teach robots how to make pancakes at Leiden University in the Netherlands, he decided it would be easier and more fun to teach kids about the structure of natural categores at New York University. He then returned to the Netherlands to be an Assistant Professor of Artificial Intelligence at Radboud University, but was lured to sunny Stanford University to study early language development. Finally, he recently realized the closest he would come to achieving his childhood dream of living on Mars would be living in the Arizona desert.
